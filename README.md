# RawInput Touchpad

Sample to capture inputs from Precision Touchpad by [Raw Input](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/raw-input) API. This is C# implementation which basically follows C++ function of [TouchpadGestures Advanced][1] by @kamektx to parse inputs from Touchpad including each contact point. Also, [RawInput.Sharp][2] by @mfakane is well sophisticated C# implementation and great help to understand this API. Many thanks!
