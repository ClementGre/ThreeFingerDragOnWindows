# Privacy Policy for ThreeFingerDragOnWindows App

## Last Updated: October 26, 2023

Clément Grennerat ("we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you use the "ThreeFingerDragOnWindows" Windows app (the "App"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your information and how we handle it.

## Overview

### Goal of ThreeFingerDragOnWindows
The "ThreeFingerDragOnWindows" app allows you to enable the macOS-style three-finger dragging functionality on Windows Precision touchpads.

### Why would ThreeFingerDragOnWindows need to be run as administrator?
When the app is not elevated (not running as an administrator), it cannot access the touchpad inputs when an elevated window is in focus. You can choose to run the app as an administrator to enable the three-finger dragging functionality even in elevated windows.

## Data Collection and Data Protection
### Information We Collect
The "ThreeFingerDragOnWindows" app does not collect or store any personal or sensitive information about you. It operates solely on your device and does not make any network requests. We do not have access to the actions performed on your touchpad nor your cursor position, as well as any data on your device.

### Data Protection
The App operates entirely on your device and does not transmit data over the internet. As a result, your personal information remains under your control.
The app can run as administrator, but would not perform any action that could not be performed by a non-elevated app, except for the touchpad inputs and the cursor movement.

## Updates
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. The latest version of the Privacy Policy will be posted on this page with the "Last Updated" date.
